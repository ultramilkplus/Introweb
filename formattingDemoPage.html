            <h1>Formatting Demo Page</h1>

            <p>This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson.</p>

            <h2>Bold and Strong</h2>

            <b>This is bold text.</b>

            <p>The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag
             but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text a more important. It is also easier
             for screen readers to read for the visually disabled.</p>

            <strong>This is what strong text looks like</strong>

            <h2>Italics and Emphasis</h2>

            <i>This text is in italics</i>

            <p>The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read.</p>

            <em>This is what emphasized text looks like</em>

            <h2>Blockquote</h2>

            <p>Blockquoted text looks like this:</p>

            <blockquote>This is the blockquote</blockquote>

            <h2>Code</h2>

            <p>Computer text looks like this (in code):<code>This is code</code></p>
